/*
    Rendering a simple array of items.
        Syntax : arrayName.map(Function)
        NOTE - map method returns a new array with each element modified based on the function.
        Here we will be using arrow function : (parameter) => return functionBody

        We can simplify the return statement by moving out the list rendering logic. e.g. nameList

    Rendering an array of object with multiple properties.
        For this the best practice is to create a component which is only responsible for displaying the data and sending the data as props from the parent component (separation of concerns).

    In console we get a warning saying that "Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop"

    In simpler words, each item in the list rendered using map should have a prop called key and the value to that prop should be unique in the list.
    NOTE - Key prop need not be an id always, it can be anything as long as it is unique.
    NOTE - Key props are not accessible in the child components. We will get this warning - "Person: `key` is not a prop. Trying to access it will result in `undefined` being returned."

    Importance of key - Keys help react identify which items in the list have changed, added or removed and plays a crucial role in handling UI updates efficiently.

    List (array) Index as key
    
    We can pass a second parameter to the map method after the elementValue, which will be the index of the element. We can now use this index as a key as it will always be an unique value.

    But using index can cause serious issues in UI.
    This example demonstrates the issue -> https://codepen.io/gopinav/pen/gQpepq

    When to use Index as a key
        1. The items in your list do not have an unique id.
        2. The list is a static list and will not change.
        3. The list will never be reordered or filtered.
